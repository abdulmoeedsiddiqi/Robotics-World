      "content": "(1) When the subject of a case concerns more than one Division, the Division in charge shall be responsible for consulting the other Division concerned and no orders shall issue, nor shall the case be submitted to the Cabinet or the Prime Minister, until it has been considered by all the Divisions concerned, and their views obtained. Such consultation shall take place as early as may be practicable:\n\nProvided that in cases of urgency and with the approval of the Prime Minster, this requirement may be dispensed with, but the case shall at the earliest opportunity thereafter be brought to the notice of the other Divisions concerned.\n\n(1A) The Division should normally furnish its views to the referring Division within a fortnight of the receipt of reference. If more time is required because of the complicated nature of the case, the referring Division should invariably be informed of the position by the end of a fortnight indicating, simultaneously, the time by which the reply would be sent.\n\n(2) In the event of a difference of opinion between the Divisions concerned, the Minister primarily concerned shall try to resolve the difference in consultation with the other Ministers concerned. If no agreement is reached and the Minister primarily concerned desires to press the case, the case shall be submitted to the Prime Minister or, if the Prime Minister so desires, to the Cabinet:\n\nProvided that in a matter of urgency, the Minister primarily concerned may submit the case to the Prime Minister at any stage:\n\nProvided further that where the Prime Minister is the Minister-in-Charge, the final views of other Divisions concerned shall be obtained before the case is submitted to the Prime Minister.\n\n(3) When a case is referred by one Division to another for consultation, all relevant facts and the points necessitating the reference shall be clearly brought out. The reference should be complete in all respects to eliminate avoidable back references on the same issue(s). Similarly replies given by the Division should also be complete in all respects and cover all the points raised by the referring Division.\n\n(4) Even where consultation is not required, a Division may, for purposes of information, pass copies of a communication received by it, or show a case, to such other Division as it considers would be interested in, or would profit by it:\n\nProvided that copies of classified documents shall be made and distributed only in accordance with the instructions issued by the Cabinet Division in accordance with rule 55(2):\n\nProvided further that copies of cypher telegrams received or dispatched by the Pakistan Crypto Centre shall be distributed in accordance with the standing orders issued by the Foreign Affairs Division in consultation with the Defence Division and the Cabinet Division.\n\n(5) A Minister may ask to see a case of another Division if it is required for the disposal of a case in his Division. The Minister for Finance may ask to see a case of any Division in which a financial consideration is involved. While making such request the Minister shall give reasons for which the case is called for and shall be dealt with under the general or special orders of the Minister-in-Charge of the other Division. If, for any reason, the case or relevant extracts from it, cannot be made available the Minister of the Division shall explain the position to the Minister making the request or bring the matter to the notice of the Prime Minister, if necessary.\n\n(6) The Prime Minister may call for a case from any Division.\n\n(7) If a Minister desires any further action to be taken on the case of another Division, he shall take up the matter with the Minister of that Division."
