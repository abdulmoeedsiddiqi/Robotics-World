(2) Effect of Set off. The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgement in respect both of the original claim and of the set off: but this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to him under the decree. (3) The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant apply to a written statement in answer to a claim of set off. Illustrations (a) A bequeaths Rs.2,000 to B and appoints C his executor and residuary legatee. B dies and D takes out administration to B's effect. C pays Rs.1,000 as surety for D: then D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set off the debt of Rs.1,000 against the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the same character with respect to the legacy as they fill with respect to the payment of the Rs.1,000. (b) A dies intestate and in debt to B.C takes out administration to A's effects and B buys part of the effects from C. In a suit for the purchase money by C against B, the latter cannot set off the debt against the price, for C fills two different characters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as representative to A."
